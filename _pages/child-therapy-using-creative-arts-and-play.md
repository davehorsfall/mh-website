Play therapy provides a safe space for children who are struggling to understand or express their thoughts and feelings. It is a predominantly child-directed process working within a supportive therapeutic relationship. Children can process feelings and any unresolved trauma creatively, using a play and creative arts toolkit including drawing/painting, clay, puppets, role play and storytelling. In this protected space, the child gains insight into their own world at their own pace, in a safe way and if necessary, without words.
