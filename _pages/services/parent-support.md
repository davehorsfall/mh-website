Children often reveal how they feel through their behaviour. It can be a worrying time when your child is finding it difficult to communicate their needs to you in words. Emotional dysregulation (anxiety, anger outbursts, sleeping or toileting difficulties, friendship difficulties) can all be symptoms of a difficulty expressing emotion or feeling. I can work with you to talk through your situation in more detail, explain the therapeutic process and provide you with practical ideas on how to help your child at home. Please feel free to request a no obligation consultation with succeeding sessions charged at an hourly rate.
