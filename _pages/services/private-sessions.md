Individual Play Therapy provides weekly sessions at a regular and consistent time and place. Your child will have access to creative materials to explore their world within a trusting therapeutic relationship. They will experience creative freedom and direct their own journey to gain insight within this relationship. These sessions have the potential to be held at your child’s school or a dedicated space in Worthing which can be arranged at the time of referral.
