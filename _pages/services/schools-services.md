Individual Play Therapy

Individual Play Therapy provides weekly sessions at a regular and consistent time and place. Children have access to creative materials to explore their world within a trusting therapeutic relationship. They will experience creative freedom and direct their own journey to gain insight within this relationship. 

Group Play Therapy

Group Play Therapy offers sessions tailored to a specific referral need. Areas that can be addressed through this form of therapy are relationship struggles, bullying, social isolation, parental separation, and chronic illness. These inform a planned series of sessions delivering experiential creative activities that foster individual and group process. In a shared experience, children can develop coping strategies are build resilience with support of their peers.  Planning focus is developed in collaboration with the school and can focus on whole school development.
